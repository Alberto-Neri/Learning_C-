I've decided to learn C++ by myself since I want to work in the robotic field. That's because, seeing the job offers, I noticed that many companies require knowledge of this language. So since I don't know it, I have less chances to get an interview. 

It's just a simple repo where I upload the example code I write during learning. 
The tutorial I follow is: https://www.learncpp.com/ .
